        <h1>Hello PSUDO World</h1>
        <p>The Penn State University Development Operations Group (PSUDO) fosters an environment for exploration of infrastructure tools that advance development-operations culture.</p>
        <p>We regularly meet and bring ideas, energy, and a desire to participate with code stained hands to learn about Dev Ops tools.</p>
        <p>The best way to engage and get started in the fast-moving dev ops environment with us is with asynchronous chat available through our slack workspace at http://psudo-group.slack.com <br />Those with @psu.edu emails will be approved to join automatically.</p>
